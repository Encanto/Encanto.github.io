This is the public site for Engineering at [Encanto Squared](http://encantosquared.com/).  We have engineering offices in the
Chicago and San Fransisco Bay areas.  We'll cover technologies
and approaches we are using or find interesting here, whether related to software development, cloud infrastructure,
devops, or the industry in general.
